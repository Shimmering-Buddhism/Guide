Here are 3 theories that are scientifically plausible and which are each conducive to thinking freely. If any of these seem incompatible with your spiritual or other understanding than not to worry since they aren't proven and are merely thought exercises. However, attachments to a particular spiritual ideal may itself be a barrier to selflessness. These may appear depressingly mechanical, but understanding them will lead to you being more selfless and loving, and feeling closer to the Spirit, God, or Energy that really is behind the mechanics, regardless of what the theory is.

## If it can happen it will happen ##

Consider that all possible universes are happening at once, and "you" happen to be the part currently experiencing "your" conscious. "You" experience the present by definition, but are in fact no more experiencing it than anyone else nor for any good reason. You've sort of woken up in this random body. So you are therefore Present by definition.

## It is determined ##

Consider that we understand physical rules to well below the level of neurons and chemical electrical impulse, and reductively "your" entire existence can be reduced back to that of a single cell that follows simple probabilistic and deterministic physical laws. So you have never had a free will. Moreover you can't take an action because of lack of free will, and one cannot take an action *because* of lack of free will since that action would have been the destined action anyway. It is literally impossible to commit suicide _because_ of knowing determinism. So one can only accept it and "float like a leaf on the river of life" (this is metaphor and doesn't equate to sitting on a couch doing any less activities, as that would itself be taking an action). Simply Be.

## The hologram ##

Consider that whatever the Scientific Unified Structure is (Universal Field / String Theory / Loop Quantum Gravity), the matter (universe) that matter (scientists) can interpret scientifically, behind that is whatever "energy" underlying, which science is incapable of interpreting by virtue of being "inside the apparatus". It would be like a person made of beach sand expecting to understand what makes up sand, measuring it using more sand. Everything you experience is just a hologram of that Energy and you're more accurately described as some indefinable subset of that Essence or Energy, instead of a flavour of atoms and compounds. And even physically, you should intuitively understand your body having a very blurry deliniation with the air and ground surrounding you, constantly swapping actual matter with it.
