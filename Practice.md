Just Be in any moment. Going by the theory there's not a lot else you can "do" anyway...

Don't expect anything at all and have total equanimity to whatever does happen. The past you can't change so don't beat yourself up on it, it won't do any good. The future doesn't "owe" you anything. So don't expect anything of it.

Look at anyone or anything and love the essence (ultimate reality) creating them or it. As best we know it's exactly the same essence behind you, so you'd be silly not to love it.

Refer to any conceptual general body of atoms only as "this" or "this one" (ie. local subset of "the one") when thinking, including of "yourself". You'll know what you mean, and it helps to undo the inaccurate impression of things being actually different from one another.

Look in the mirror until you see only a (perhaps slightly goofy looking?) stranger's body. Next, focus on the stranger's eyes and love that stranger's eyes.

Practice meditating until you can get to completely blank mind. You can enter meditation by focusing on something eg. sound or breathing, blankness itself, but should then aim to not focus on anything and try to get closer to a state of sleep. You can create a bit of pressure on the eyes and eye lids to mildly disrupt thought. Day-dreaming / meditative / in-the-zone thought is actually pretty fine and not considered bad. The conscious may at some point feel like it "slipped" further back into the entire back of the head.
