The goal of this path is to be awake, easy, happy and loving.

## Method ##

All of the above follow from selflessness (translation of emptiness in Buddhism). Understanding selflessness and empty mind is to be awake to the nature of reality. That leads to being easy and happy, since "you" isn't a concept to be taken seriously. It also leads to a total love of everything you perceive, including all others. Naturally your relationships all improve and you even understand that upset or angry people just are that way, and that's okay with you. It doesn't make you a doormat to those people either, just more understanding.

But to get to understanding selflessness you first have to immerse yourself in the theory and understanding of why that's the case - why "you" aren't special but that the world you experience is the most special thing you can ever experience. First understand the theory.

Once you understand the theory, put it into practice. Don't expect anything and don't cling to any precious ideas, just do it.

All the best. Please open an Issue if you have any questions or improvements to make :)
